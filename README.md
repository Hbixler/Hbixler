### Day By Day
I worked on this app by myself as a side project to intersect my interest in writing stories and app development. It is a prototype for a game where the user has to drag and drop text messages into the correct order to reveal the conversation. Each level contains the texts for that day so that the story gradually unfolds.

### Rise Together
My group partnered with the nonprofit organization RISE to create an app for prisoners upon release. This prototype allows users to upload housing opportunities, job opportunities, and life events to a table using custom table cells.

### Galactic Guidebook
This was one of the first apps developed during my design thinking internship in 2020. It experiments with table cells and customized classes. The app was also an introduction to Github for me and my collaborators.

## Python

### Titanic Machine Learning Competition
After completing an introductory course in high school, I entered a machine learning competition on the site Kaggle. My best solution had an accuracy rate of 78.9% and used packages like scikit-learn. The file here contains my solution set for the problem.

### Calculator
I wrote this program to experiment with using stacks to perform operations. In this case, the class takes a string such as “3 * 6 - 12” and returns the calculated value.

### Range Detector
This program takes in a list of numbers and detects if any of them belong to a consecutive range. It returns this list of numbers with the consecutive numbers replaced by the range, so for example {5, 1, 2, 3} would return “5, 1-3”.

## Java

### Morse Code
This program takes in a text file and processes each word into the corresponding morse code. It also raises a custom exception when an invalid character is mingled in with the text (not A-Z).
